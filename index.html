    <h3>Forsbergs Arcade Machine Game Integration System version 0.1</h3>
    <p>Prototyped by Sixten and ChatGPT</p>
    <p>Repo of this website: <a href="YOUR_REPO_URL" target="_blank">GitHub Repository Link</a></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Please read this page thoroughly, then follow the steps described to integrate your game into the arcade machine.</p>

    <h3>Repository Naming</h3>
    <p><strong>Name your repository</strong> exactly as you wish your actual game title to appear, with capital letters as desired.</p>

    <h3>Platform Supported</h3>
    <p><strong>Windows only</strong> is supported, as previously agreed upon.</p>

    <h3>Repository Contents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Game binary files (.exe and supporting files from the build directory)</li>
        <li>Your license</li>
        <li>A preview .gif file for the arcade machine launcher</li>
        <li>(Optional) A "Demo" folder containing demo build files and your license, for one-time playability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Integration Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Build your game for Windows and ensure all necessary files are in a folder named exactly as your game title.</li>
        <li>Create a GitHub repository with this folder's name.</li>
        <li>Once you've reviewed all steps, authenticate on this page by clicking "Authenticate with GitHub to Continue."</li>
        <li>After authentication, select the repository to integrate.</li>
        <li>Complete the metadata form with any required information, such as payout accounts, which can also be left blank if not needed.</li>
        <li>Submit, and a repository invitation request will be automatically sent to my GitHub account.</li>
        <li>GitHub Actions will automate the rest, such as accepting the invite, creating and pushing a metadata.json file, and further setup as necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Editing Metadata</h3>
    <p>You can edit the <strong>metadata.json</strong> file created by GitHub Actions. The structure is human-readable and allows you to update payout accounts and allocations as needed.</p>

    <h3>Updating Your Game</h3>
    <p>To update your game, rebuild it, replace the files in your repository, and push the changes.</p>
